# War Game Complexity Comparison 

for COIN series

Junqian Zhang

**Abstract**:
This project aims at comparing the complexity of war games from COIN series by exploring their rule setting. The comparison is based on the features extracted from general war game category, under the assumption that the more complex COIN series game covers more features and has more rules on one feature. The final result is reflected on the complexity index.

**Key Words**:

COIN Series, War Game, Aspect Extraction, Information Retrieval
